# ShareGPT Builder

ShareGPT Builder is a versatile Gradio application that provides two key functionalities for training Language Learning Models (LLMs). 

The application is designed to run locally, and submitted examples will be stored locally in the applications directory, but can also be served as a web application to anyone.

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Conversation Sample Builder:

Firstly, it allows you to manually construct and store ShareGPT Formatted (SFT) conversations involving a system, a human, and GPT role or the Standard Formatted conversations involving a system, a user and an assistant. These conversations are automatically uploaded to huggingface.

For datasets using this format, refer to the [Hermes 2.5 Dataset here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5).

### Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) RLHF Sample Builder:
Secondly, the application also includes a DPO Sample Builder. This feature enables the creation of sample comparison conversation responses, for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This data gets automatically uploaded to the hub, and is in the Intel NeuralChat DPO format.
